# NLP-domain-_NRAKEL
Function: NLP (domain) multi-tag identification of membrane protein types. According to the data set S1 in UniProt database (release 2012_09) and protein2ipr.txt in InterPro database, the IPR word vector corresponding to the protein is obtained. , The random k-label set (RAKEL) algorithm is used to construct a multi-label classifier, and the random forest is used as the basic algorithm. Construct a multi-label classifier NLP (domain)-NRAKEL. Through strict ten-fold cross-validation, the accuracy and exact matching degree of the classifier are both higher than 0.85. It greatly proves the superiority of our model and improves the accuracy of membrane protein identification.
